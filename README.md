## Motivation :space_invader: 
This is a simple project I've made to learn more about NextJS.

You can check this project [LIVE](https://moveit-arthurobdfv.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used :rocket:
* [Next](https://nextjs.org/) - Framework used on top of React;
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - The programming language that can be used with Next, its possible to use JavaScript aswell;
* [GitHub](https://github.com) - My source control tool
* [Trello](https://trello.com) - Task tracking source, I also use a notebook and a pencil to keep things organized :)
