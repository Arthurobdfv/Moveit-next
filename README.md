# Move-It ðŸš€ 


## Motivation :space_invader: 
We spend a lot of time in front of a coputer screen, and that can make some damages on your spine / eyes / joints if you dont take care. Move it is an app on which will remind you do to some exercises in form of a challenge on a fixed amount of time, so you can focus on your work but still remain healthy :).

This is a simple project I've made to learn more about NextJS.
